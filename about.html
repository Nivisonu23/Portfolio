          <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
          <p>I'm NIVEDITHA M and I'm a final year student from St.Joseph's Institute Of Technology. Currently, I'm pursuing Bachelors of Technology in the department of Information Technology. I would love to design websites and that's the reason for this Portfolio and this portfolio is based on the concept of movies.
          </p>

          <p>I would suggest to pick any random movie and watch it till the end, doesn't matter how bad or slow it is. Whether you want romance, comedy, drama, or any genre in between, these are the are best and most essential films to watch now. A film with high-quality production value has good props; great sets; excellent visual effects and camera work and amazing sound design, all coming together to create a cohesive movie-going experience.</p>
